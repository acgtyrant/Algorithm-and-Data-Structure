# Algorithm-and-Data-Structure
算法与数据结构之道

I write some C++ inplements of some data structs and algorithms in this project.

You can read the [wiki](../../wiki) about my experienc in Chinese. By the way, many links may be Chinese.

## Done

* [binary-search](../../wiki/二分查找)
* selection-sort
* [quick-sort](../../wiki/快速排序)
* [complex class](../../wiki/复数类)
* string class
* insertion-sort
* [merge-sort](../../wiki/归并排序)

I try my best to implement these, but I still failed, so welcome some pull requests.

## Incomplete

* heap-sort: origin and in-place implements test failed.

## TODO

- [x] Use template to generification.
- [ ] Use unit test framework.
- [x] Swap vector in merge-sort to optimize it.
- [x] Use insertion-sort in small vector from merge-sort to optimize it.
- [ ] Improve quick-sort to anti duplicate.
- [x] Make insertion-sort compatible with the swap implement of merge-sort.

- [x] Implement string class.
- [ ] Implement vector<T> template.
- [ ] Implement expression calculator by node class inheritance system.

- [ ] [N-Queen Problem](http://www.zhihu.com/question/22608820/answer/21968467).
- [ ] LeetCode?
