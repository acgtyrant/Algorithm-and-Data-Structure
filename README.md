# Algorithm-and-Data-Structure
算法与数据结构之道

I write some C++ inplements of some data structs and algorithms in this project.

You can read the [wiki](../../wiki) about my experienc in Chinese.

## Done

* [binary-search](../../wiki/二分查找)
* selection-sort
* [quick-sort](../../wiki/快速排序)

I try my best to implement these, but I still failed, so welcome some pull requests.

## Incomplete

* merge-sort: test failed.
* heap-sort: origin and in-place implements test failed.

## TODO

* Use template to generification.
* Use unit test framework.
* Swap vector in merge-sort to optimize it.
* Use insertion-sort in small vector from merge-sort to optimize it.
* Improve quick-sort to anti duplicate.
* Implement complex number class.
* Implement string class.
* Implement vector<T> template.
* Implement expression calculator by node class inheritance system.

## Contributions

Time to select from all these... things!
